In this work, we present an application of the multiscale method for the Geomechanical problem of linear elasticity. The application consists of using a multiscale preconditioner with a fine space preconditioner to reduce the number of iterations of linear solvers such as Conjugate Gradient and Bicgstab. The results show comparisons between the use of additive and multiplicative coupled preconditioners showing that, in cases where the coarsening is sufficiently high, the lower complexity of the additive can speed up the solution process. In addition, a comparison with a multigrid solver is shown, both  being used as preconditioners for the Conjugate Gradient.
